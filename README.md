## Documentation

Currently Boe Tea possesses a limited amount of features. All commands can be described on a single page, what I'm about to prove right here.

-   `bt!sauce` - tries to find original image source on SauceNAO or ASCII2D search engine.
    -   _Usage_: `bt!sauce <optional reverse search engine> <optional link>`. If reverse search engine is not present uses guild's default. If link is not present looks up for an attachment.
-   `bt!pixiv` - advanced pixiv command, let's you exclude certain pictures.
    -   _Usage_: ``bt!pixiv <pixiv link> [excluded pictures]
    -   _pixiv link_: Required link to a pixiv post.
    -   _excluded pictures_: Array of excluded pictures separated by space, supports range syntax (e.g. `1-7` excludes 1 through 7 inclusively)
    -   _Example_: `bt!pixiv https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/81893997 2-3` will repost only the first image of the set.
-   `bt!twitter` - reposts all images from a tweet, useful for mobile that doesn't support all images natively.
    -   _Usage_: `bt!twitter <required tweet link>`
-   `bt!deepfry` - deepfries an image for le epic memes.
    -   _Usage_: ``bt!deepfry <image link> <times deepfried>
    -   _image link_: optional if image is attached, link is prioritized if both are present.
    -   _times deepfried_: optional, fries even deeper, up to 5 times.
    -   _Example_: `bt!deepfry https://imgur.com/image.png 5`
-   `bt!help` - displays Boe Tea's command documentation
-   `bt!set` - displays current guild settings or changes them (e.g `bt!set prefix uwu`)
    -   _prefix_: prefix to invoke Boe Tea's commands. String up to 5 characters, if last character is a letter whitespace is assumed.
    -   _largeset_: amount of images considered a large set that procs a confirmation prompt.
    -   _pixiv_: boolean value, switches reposting functionality. Accepts _t, true, f, false_.
    -   _reversesearch_: default reverse image search engine. Accepts **SauceNAO** or **ASCII2D**.
    -   _repost_: ~~Default reposting behaviour. Accepts **links**, **embeds**, and **ask** options.~~ Deprecated, but being replaced soon tm.
    -   _limit_: Hard limit to album size. If you attempt to repost a post/bulk-repost posts with more images it'll fail.
    -   _promptemoji_: Custom prompt emoji. Only local guild and standard emojis are supported as of now.
-   `bt!ping` - checks if Boe Tea online and sends its ping back

## Additional features

-   NSFW check. If Pixiv post has an R-18 tag it's only allowed to be reposted in NSFW channels.
-   Ability to delete an image after it was posted (react ‚ùå `:x:` to Boe Tea's message)
